# SoloScale Yoga MCP 🧘‍♀️

Hey there, yoga teachers! Welcome to our project designed to help you create engaging classes and keep your students coming back for more. We've created three friendly MCP servers to enhance your teaching and build a loyal student community.

With the global wellness industry exceeding $4.5 trillion and over 300,000 yoga teachers worldwide struggling with fragmented tools, we saw the need for a unified platform. 

Most teachers juggle 5-7 different apps for sequence planning, student engagement, and pose instruction—wasting time that could be spent teaching. 

That's why we built this all-in-one (There could be more, but for now!) MCP solution to streamline your workflow and help you focus on what matters most: inspiring your students and growing your business.
