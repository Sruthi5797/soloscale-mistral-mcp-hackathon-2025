# SoloScaleYoga 🧘‍♀️

Welcome, yoga teachers! 🌟

Are you ready to create unforgettable classes and build a thriving student community? Our project brings you **three powerful MCP servers**—designed to make your teaching easier, more engaging, and more impactful.

**Why SoloScale Yoga MCP?**
- The global wellness industry is booming ($4.5+ trillion!), yet over **300,000 yoga teachers** face scattered tools and wasted time.
- Most teachers juggle **5–7 different apps** for planning, engagement, and pose correction—leaving less time for what you love: teaching.

**Our Solution:**  
A unified, all-in-one MCP based platform  that streamlines your workflow, so you can:
- **Plan creative sequences** effortlessly
- **Connect with students** and foster loyalty
- **Guide poses** with smart, gentle feedback

Focus on inspiring your students and growing your business—let us handle the rest. ✨
